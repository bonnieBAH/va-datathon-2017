## Read in Shape Files and Key

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

require(raster)
require(dplyr)
require(pander)
require(leaflet)
csb.shp <- raster::shapefile("./shapefiles/CSBfinal_1.shp")

csb.key <- read.csv("./CSB_FIPS_GIS.csv")

csb.only <- csb.key %>% group_by(CSBName, OBJECTID,FID) %>% summarize(count=n()) %>% arrange(OBJECTID)

print(str(csb.shp))

```

## Draw a map



```{r map}
leaflet(csb.shp) %>% addTiles() %>% addPolygons(weight = 1)
```

## Get labels for map???

Need to combine the CSB key with the shapefiles as a **SpatialPolygonsDataFrame** in order to give it labels .... 

```{r makething}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
